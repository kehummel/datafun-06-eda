# Choose Data Set 

I chose a data set called Student Performance in Exams. It has data on students' gender, race/ethnicity, parent level of education, free-lunch eligibility, test preparation, math score, reading score, and writing score. 

It can be downloaded using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

# Install, Clean, and Organize Data

After loading the data I changed the column names to follow the standard naming conventions we use in python. I also averaged students reading and writing scores to come up with an ELA score. This made it easier for me to compare other variables to simply math or ela scores. 

# Analysing the Data

Then I decided which variables to compare to the math and ela scores. I chose gender, parents' level of education, and whether or not the students took a test preparation course. I compared the data by creating box and whisker plots of ela and math scores separately of student who fit into each variable. Meaning I compared male and female students' ela scores, and then male and female students' math scores. I compared the ela scores of students whose parents had an associates, bachelors, or masters degree versus the ela scores of students whose parents did not have a college degree. I made the same comparison but for their math scores instead. I compared the ela scores of students who took a test preparation course to the ela scores of students who did not take the test preparation course. I made this same comparison but for their math scores as well. 

# Summarization 

I then looked at the results in the tables and wrote a summary statement about the data.
